                <p><strong>User Information that we collect.&nbsp;</strong></p>

                <p>Inherently, the Pintex Solutions platform is constructed to share appropriate information between authorized users. While we do share information, you will have choices in how your data is made publicly available when on the platform.&nbsp;</p>

If you contact us, we keep a record of that interaction, including any e-mail that you send to us.&nbsp;</p>
                <ol start="3">
                    <li>&ldquo;Web Activity Information&rdquo; gathered by us and our third-party service providers.&nbsp;</li>
                </ol>
                <p>When you visit the Pintex Solutions Platform and participate in the sharing of information with other users of the Platform and the various services and tools available on the Platform, we may collect or track information on users&rsquo; actions on the Platform or &ldquo;Web Activity Information&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>This type of &ldquo;Web Activity Information&rdquo; is generally collected from two sources. One is from the server log files and the other is from cookies.&nbsp;</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>IP Address&nbsp;</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Your IP address is a number that is assigned by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) to your computer to identify its location. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Platform. We also sometimes use IP addresses to communicate with Users, monitor the use of the Platform, prevent fraud and possibly even ban those visitors or Users who are not complying with our Terms of Use.&nbsp;</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cookies&nbsp;</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Our site uses a feature of your browser to set a &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; on your computer. Cookies are small packets of information that a site&rsquo;s computer stores on your computer. We can then read the cookies whenever you visit the Platform. We use cookies to save your password so you don&rsquo;t have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, to deliver content or links specific to your interests, to track the pages you&rsquo;ve visited. These cookies allow us to use the Web Activity Information we collect to customize your experience so that your use of the Platform is as relevant and as valuable to you as possible.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>You may modify your browser preference to provide you with choices relating to cookies. You have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may be unable to use that part of the Platform or access or use any portion of the Platform that requires registration in order to participate or will have to sign in each time you visit the Platform.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We do not provide to any third parties, advertisers, solicitors or vendors of services or products with any &ldquo;Personally Identifiable Information&rdquo; about you.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>However, we may use and share aggregate &ldquo;Non-Personally Identifiable Personal Information&rdquo; or &ldquo;Web Activity Information&rdquo; about Users&rsquo; visits to the Platform and other sites to Pintex Licensee&rsquo;s in connection with our efforts to broaden the base of Users of the Platform and enhance or improve the functionality and value of the Platform.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Guidelines Regarding Children.&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p>Personal information about children is a concern for all of us. We take the protection of children&rsquo;s privacy very seriously. We do not allow participation or visitation by children under the age of 13. Visitors who are known to be under the age of 13 are prohibited from becoming a User of the Pintex Solutions Platform. Children between the age of 13 and 18 must have the permission of a parent or guardian to access and use the Platform.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>How We Use &ldquo;User Information&rdquo; We Collect.&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p>We use the &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo; and &ldquo;Web Activity Information&rdquo; you provide for several purposes, such as an information exchange for the users, to communicate with you and to operate and improve the Pintex Solutions Platform and to give you a better experience when visiting us by personalizing tools, content, services and e-mail messages. We also use this &ldquo;User Information&rdquo; to build new services and develop offers that we believe are more relevant and valuable to you and others who are similarly situated.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Based on your user type (teacher, educator, business professional, student, etc.) we will share your information on a voluntary basis with other users. For example, when you volunteer your profile as a business professional to work with a school, we will share that business professional&rsquo;s information placed on our platform with the school or schools designated by the business professional as a school where they are willing to volunteer.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The &ldquo;Non-Personally Identifiable Personal Information&rdquo; and &ldquo;Web Activity Information&rdquo; collected by us is also used to create aggregated portraits of our User base, that is, portraits which present anonymous statistical demographic information, but no personal data or Personally Identifiable Information. For instance, we gather information about how you and other similarly situated use the Platform using log files, tracking pixels and database history tables. This aggregated information is used, among other things, to determine trends and needs and it is compiled and analyzed on an aggregate and de-identified basis.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We will also use the aggregated &ldquo;Non-Personally Identifiable Personal Information&rdquo; and &ldquo;Web Activity Information&rdquo; discussed above, but no &ldquo;Personally Identifiable Personal Information&rdquo; linked to it, to supply market research to third-parties to help them take advantage of the educational opportunities and services available on the Platform and being sought by Users of the Platform.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We will also use your e-mail address to send you e-mails that are generated when you perform certain functions at the Platform. The types of e-mails that maybe sent include, but are not limited to, e-mails notifying you of changes in the Platform or its functionality, limitations on services or functions available and other similar operations related material.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>You Opt-In for Disclosure of &ldquo;User Information&rdquo; to Certain Third Parties.&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p>We do not sell or otherwise share any &ldquo;User Information&rdquo; with unaffiliated third parties without your consent (please see &ldquo;Our Opt-In/Opt-Out Policy&rdquo; below), except in the following instances: (i) disclosure is required by applicable law or pursuant to a court or similar order or we otherwise believes in good faith that the law requires it; (ii) as deemed necessary, in our sole discretion, to enforce our legal rights or to protect our property, to enforce or protect the legal rights or property of a User or any other third party, or to prevent personal injury of any person; (iii) in the event of a sale, merger, assignment, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of a portion or all of our assets or stock or the assets or stock of any of our affiliated entities (including, without limitation, in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings); (iv) disclosure of aggregate &ldquo;Non-Personally Identifiable Personal Information&rdquo; and &ldquo;Web Activity Information&rdquo; to third-parties for purposes of research or other educational purposes and (v) disclosure to any&nbsp;</p>
                <p>of our third-party service and Platform support providers. More specifically, we may provide &ldquo;User Information&rdquo; to third parties who are providing technical or fulfillment services on our behalf.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>You may edit your User Account and disable the &ldquo;Receive e-mails&rdquo; option (see &ldquo;Opting-Out&rdquo; below).&nbsp;</p>
                <p>As stated above, the &ldquo;Non-Personally Identifiable Personal Information&rdquo; and &ldquo;Web Activity Information&rdquo; you provide on pages of the Pintex Solutions Platform, including those that are co- branded with a third party (including tools that are hosted by a third party), may be shared with third-parties on an aggregated basis, for research or other educational purposes, and in these instances, your permission will not be requested since no personal data or &ldquo;Personally Identifiable Information&rdquo; will be shared or provided to these third parties. We will, however, use commercially reasonable efforts to contractually require all such third parties to agree not to use any &ldquo;Non-Personally Identifiable Personal Information&rdquo; about any User, in conjunction with other sources of information, or otherwise, to identify you.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Our Opt-In/Opt-Out Policy.&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><em>Opting-In&nbsp;</em></p>

                <p>24. Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration&nbsp;</p>
                <p>24.1 Initial Dispute Resolution Process.</p>
                <p>We intend to resolve any and all disputes that may arise between us and our Users in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner, preferably without the time and expense of litigation. Toward this end, you agree to the following dispute resolution procedure. If you are unable to resolve any dispute in the ordinary course of business, you shall send a written notice to us in which you outline the issues in dispute, enclose any relevant documents, and state the requested relief. We shall respond within ten (10) business days with identical information from its perspective. You and one of our representatives shall meet or communicate electronically within ten (10) business days of the delivery of the response, and as often as you and we mutually deem necessary or desirable thereafter, in an attempt to resolve the matter. If, within sixty (60) days of the first communication, we fail to resolve the matter, you may then proceed to arbitration as described in Section 25.2 below.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>24.2 Arbitration.</p>
                <p>After failing to mutually settle any disputes as required in Section 23.1, and except for equitable claims, small claims court, and claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party&rsquo;s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Service provided hereunder shall be submitted to and settled through binding arbitration.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>(a) The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with this Agreement, the Federal Arbitration Act and the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;). In the event of a conflict, the provisions of the AAA Rules will control, except where those Rules conflict with this Agreement, in which case this Agreement will control.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>(b) The arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator selected as provided in the AAA Rules and who shall have at least five (5) years of relevant experience. The arbitration shall be commenced and held in the State of Minnesota. No potential arbitrator may be appointed unless he or she has agreed in writing to be bound by these procedures.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>(c) To the extent state law is applicable, the arbitrator shall apply the substantive law of the State of Minnesota. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Goods shall not apply. Any issue concerning the location of the arbitration, the extent to which any dispute is subject to arbitration, the applicability, interpretation, or enforceability of these procedures, including any contention that all or part of these procedures are invalid or unenforceable, and any discovery disputes, shall be resolved by the arbitrator.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>(d) Each party will be entitled to reasonable discovery in preparation for the arbitration, including the production of relevant documents and the deposition of witnesses. Any disputes involving discovery shall be heard and resolved by the arbitrator. All objections are reserved for the arbitration hearing, except for objections based on privilege and proprietary or confidential information.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>(e) All aspects of the arbitration shall be treated as confidential and neither the parties nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of the arbitration, except as necessary to comply with legal or regulatory requirements. Before making any such disclosure, a party shall give written notice to all other parties and shall afford such parties a reasonable opportunity to protect their interests.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>(f) The decision of the arbitrator shall be reduced to writing, shall be final and binding on the parties except for fraud, misconduct, or errors of law, and judgment upon the decision rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator may not, in any event, make any ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>(g) The arbitrator shall award all costs of the arbitration, including arbitrator&rsquo;s fees, arbitration filing fees, travel costs of witnesses, costs of depositions and reasonable attorney fees to the substantially prevailing party; provided, however, that if the User is the substantially prevailing party, the User shall bear the costs of its own attorney fees.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>24.3 Class Action Waiver. We each agree that any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute, whether through a court of law or arbitration, shall be solely conducted on an individual basis. You agree that you will not seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, representative action, collective action, private attorney general action, or similar action.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>24.4 Wavier of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BOTH PARTIES ARE GIVING UP THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND, IF APPLICABLE, ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO BRING ANY CLAIMS ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, CONSOLIDATED OR MASS ACTION BASIS.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>24.5 Injunctive Relief. Nothing herein shall prevent either party from seeking immediate injunctive relief pursuant to the Emergency Measures of Protection procedures in the AAA Commercial Rules if, in its judgment, such relief is necessary to protect its interests prior to utilizing or completing this dispute resolution process. Such remedy shall be in addition to all other remedies, including money damages, available to such&nbsp;party at law or in equity. You also agree that any violation by you of this Agreement will constitute an unlawful and unfair business practice that will cause irreparable harm to us for which monetary damages would be inadequate. You consent to our obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that we deem necessary or appropriate in such circumstances, without the need for a bond. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies we may have at law or in equity.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>24.6 Limitations. No action arising out of this Agreement or your access to or use of our Platform, regardless of form or the basis of the claim, may be brought by you more than one (1) year after the cause of action has arisen (or if multiple causes, from the date the first such case arose) and you hereby waive any longer statute of limitations that may be permitted by law.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>25. Miscellaneous.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>25.1 Applicable Law and Venue.</p>
                <p>Any action related to the Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions of any jurisdiction. We each agree and consent that jurisdiction, proper venue, and the most convenient forums for all claims, actions, and proceedings of any kind relating to the Platform or the Agreement that are not submitted to arbitration will be exclusively in the federal or local courts with jurisdiction over Minnesota. If we do take any legal action against you as a result of your violation of the Agreement, we will be entitled to recover from you, and you agree to pay, all reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs of such action, in addition to any other relief granted to us. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for termination of your access to, or use of, the Platform as a result of any violation of the Agreement or for any reason at all.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>25.2 Entire Agreement.</p>
                <p>This Agreement (including the various Additional Terms incorporated herein by reference) constitute the entire agreement between you and AEA, and supersedes any and all prior agreements, negotiations, or other communications between you and us, whether oral or written, with respect to the subject matter hereof, and, except as expressly provided herein, cannot be modified except in writing signed by both parties.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>25.3 Severability.</p>
                <p>In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then: (a) such provision shall be deemed reformed to the extent strictly necessary to render such provision valid and enforceable, or if not capable of such reformation shall be deemed severed from this Agreement; and (b) the validity and enforceability of all of the other provisions hereof, shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>25.4 Waiver.</p>
                <p>No failure or delay in enforcing any provision, exercising any option, or requiring performance, shall be construed to be a waiver of that or any other right in connection with the Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>25.5 Assignment.</p>
                <p>You may not assign, by operation of law or otherwise, any rights or delegate any duties under the Agreement to any third party, including in connection with a merger or change of control, without prior written consent by us. Any purported assignment lacking such consent will be void at its inception. We may assign all or part of its rights and/or delegate all or part of its duties under the Agreement to any party, at any time, and in its sole discretion, upon notice of assignment by posting such notice on the Platform.&nbsp;</p>
